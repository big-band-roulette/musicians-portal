      Welcome to the Big Band Roulette musicians' portal. This is the one-stop shop for everything related to playing with us.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      If you have just registered on the portal, the first step is to go to the auditions page and sign up for a slot.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Once you've had your audition, you will be able to register for upcoming events on the events page,
      for a chance to be randomly selected to join the band.
    </p>
